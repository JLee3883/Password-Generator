Pseudo Code

Alert needed to "How many characters would you like your password to contain?
If I put less than 8, there will be a pop up that says that "Password lenth must be at least 8 characters.
Then need to have an available button to click "OK" for the user to acknowledge.
User can hit the "Generate Password" button again to prompt how many characters would your password contain?
If user puts 1000, and click "OK", the alert should say "Password length must be less than 129 characters.
Then, when user inputs length no less than 8 and no more than 129, a window alert must pop up to:
    1.) Click OK to confirm including special characters (user has choice to OK or cancel)
    2.) Click OK to confirm including numeric characters (user has choice to OK or cancel)
    3.) Click OK to confirm including lowercase characters. (user has choice to OK or cancel)
    4.) Click OK to confirm including upperercase characters. (user has choice to OK or cancel)
Once user clicks OK, a random password containing all the chosen characters will automatically generate in the box.
